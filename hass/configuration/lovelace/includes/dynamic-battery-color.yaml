# This is the battery icon color template used to color
# the icon according to the state of a battery. E.g. if 
# a battery state drops below 50% the icon will turn orange
# if it drops under 20% it turns red. If charged it will
# be green.
# This template can be used in conjunction with the dynamic
# battery icon template. This template can also be used for
# anything else you want to give these colors. The colors
# are decided against an entity's state. In my config it
# is a battery entity, but it could as well be anything
# else with a number as state.
