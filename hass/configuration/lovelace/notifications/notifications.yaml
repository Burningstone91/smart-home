# Please edit this file to your own need, I only provide this file as an
# example on how to create this. In the first card (the All Clear card)
# you should put in every entity that you want to show a notification with
# as you only want that card to show if you have no notifications. Follow
# the example below (srry the notifications are in Dutch so you will have
# to use your own!) Do not make them too long as they might not fit in the
# bar. Shorter notifications will probably look better!
